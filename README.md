## Your goal

A famous restaurant is loosing customers lately because of a lack of innovation...  
They need you (a fancy senior cook üßë‚Äçüç≥) to help them with something fresh and new.

- Hence, they are asking you to create a new menu including the following **categories**:
  - Starters
  - Seafood
  - Chief's special
  - Main dishes
  - Desserts

- All of those categories will need **few recipes** in them with the following:
  - name 
  - ingredients
  - description (fancy if possible)

During the service, the team will need an app to show them what to focus on. You must develop **a small interface** to browse recipes. You must manage categories, listing recipes and viewing a single recipe. Essentially this is a digital recipe book.

### If you would like to go further
- Feel free to implement any additional feature that would fit in this project, but first ensure the minimum is here.
- A search field can be added to quickly look for a **dish name** or a specific **ingredient**.
- You could add a "make this recipe" with checkboxes, like a todo, to help inexperienced kitchen clerks prepare a recipe. 
- At this part of the exercise, you could let the whole team access the app with a single username + password combo (like `supercrew` + `secretsaucepwd`).
- The restaurant will have a designated crew specialized in their own field, like a `sauce chef`, `vegetable chef` and so on... You can get an example of a possible hierarchy on [this page](https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk/hub/kitchen-hierarchy-brigade-de-cuisine/). You could handle the fact that a chef **will not have a recipe tied to something that they cannot do**.
- If your crew feels creative, you can provide the ability to **create**, **edit** and **delete** the recipes of each specialized chef's category.
- You could add an order system with a customer menu tied to it.

### What we expect from you
- This outcome of this project must be a repository with your code.
- We expect this to take between 2 and 4 hours.
- You must use [this project](https://github.com/TulioMolina/graphql-recipes-api) to have a ready GraphQL project. It's easy to setup and works well as a backend. Any feedback or change on its schema will be appreciated during the interview review.
- We'd like you to use Nuxt.js for this project but you can use Vue.js alone. The configuration of your app is totally flexible. You can install and configure GraphQL/Apollo as you want.
- The use of Vuex is up to you.
- We don't require that you work on deployment and host the project somewhere. Do as you like.
- Since the main focus is not on the styling, you can use any CSS framework (or none) that you'd like.
